Pokemon Romhack Decomp of Pokemon Emerald

This project is intended to provide a bit of a twist on a pokemon playthrough, where the ability to capture pokemon is severely limited for much of the main game. As such, players may have to be a bit more 
creative with their pokemon choices than they normally are. Options for pokemon will be increased though, and it isn't intended to be an unreasonably difficult game.
